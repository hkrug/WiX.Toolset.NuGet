        <description>This package contains the binaries needed to compile Windows Installer XML (WiX) setup projects. 
        Just add this NuGet package to your WiX setup projects and you're done (no setup required on build servers etc.). 
        Note that you still need to install WiX Toolset in Visual Studio to get the editor experience.
